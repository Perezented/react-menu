# Restaurant Menu using React and Redux

This is a react menu mock from a local restaurant. It is pulling data from a back end server that is holding all the menu items and is recieving the cart orders.  
The site is able to add one item to the cart, or multiple by selecting from a input box or with the buttons provided. The cart automatically displays the total of the items.  
A user is also able to select menu items by category.  
There is a special of the day that the restautant has, so if the selected user is an employee and has a login, they are able to edit the special of the day.
